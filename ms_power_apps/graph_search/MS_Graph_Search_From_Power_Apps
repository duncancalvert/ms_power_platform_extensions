// This is Power Fx Microsoft Power Apps code showing how to set up a "Search Box" in your application.
// This allows users to make runtime "Google-like" searches against an MS Graph index that are then returned to a gallery.

Set (search_string, Substitute(Search_Box.Text, " ", " OR "));

// 2. A regex expression is used to find any solitary characters in the string as they may be misspelled. These are then concategnated with the nearest word
